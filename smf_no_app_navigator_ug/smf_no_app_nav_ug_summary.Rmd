## Overview `r fontawesome::fa("binoculars")`
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("imgs/test_summary.png"))
```

<br>

__Theory:__ The FYE-101 course is a free introductory orientation course designed to help new students familiarize themselves with the learning management system.

__Hypothesis:__ Sending an email to prospective students dispositioned as Student Moving Forward - No App will increase application rates.

## Test Design `r fontawesome::fa("flask")` {.tabset .tabset-pills} 

__Test Metric:__ Application Rate, calculated as:
$$Application Rate  = \sum_{n=Apps} / \sum_{n=SMF No App Leads}$$

__Testing Groups:__ Of all eligible members of the population (full criteria list below), control and experiment groups were assigned in Marketing Cloud
+ Control Group: **50%** received navigator email
+ Experiment Group: **50%** did not receive navigator email

Emails are generated approximately two hour after phone call with admissions counselor.

**Experiment Population Eligibility (AKA InPopulation):**

+ UG students in Inquired Stage
+ Call dispositioned as "Student Moving Forward No App"
+ Student has admissions portal access

this is as far as I got

<br>


### Example Email


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("imgs/.png"))
```

## Outcomes & Learnings `r fontawesome::fa("chart-bar")`

__Overall Results:__ As of 3//21, Application Rate for the test group was **x percentage points higher (% change)**. This difference is statistically significant with a % confidence level and two-sided test.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("imgs/.png"))

__Interpreting the Results__

+ __Confidence Level:__ The percentage of confidence that the result is a consequence of the change made or treatment administered and not a result of random chance.

+ __Statistical Significance:__ A test result is said to be "statistically significant" when the difference between the results of the test and control groups is too big to have been a result of chance.

+ __One-Sided vs. Two-Sided Test__ A one sided test is used when we only want to prove that the *increase* in conversions (i.e. the metric) that occurred for the test group is significant; it does not consider whether any *decrease* in conversions is significant. A two-sided test evaluates the significance of the test group conversions being higher *or* lower as compared to the control. If we want to be certain that a treatment being tested does not have a negative impact on the metric, then a two-sided test should be conducted.
